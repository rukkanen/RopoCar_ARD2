# üöó RoboCar Project: The Guard Bot You Didn't Know You Needed (or Wanted) üö®

### Welcome to RoboCar, the pinnacle of modern robotic innovation! If by "pinnacle," you mean a DIY project held together by sheer willpower, questionable solder joints, and the dreams of future overlords... then yes, we've nailed it. üòé

## ü§ñ Project Overview: 

Imagine this: A robot car that roams your apartment, takes pictures of intruders, and maps your space like it's preparing for a small-scale invasion. All this, while looking like it was assembled by a caffeine-addled hobbyist on a Sunday afternoon. 

RoboCar isn't just a bot; it's a lifestyle. A lifestyle where your security is... kind of, almost, maybe guaranteed by a mobile platform that might not even know the difference between a burglar and your houseplant. üåø

**What Does RoboCar Do?**
- **Idle Mode:** Because sometimes, doing nothing is doing something. RoboCar waits. Patiently. 
- **Guard Mode:** Detects movement with all the grace of a stumbling toddler. When something moves, it takes a photo. Will it be clear? Who knows! But hey, it tried.
- **Toy Mode:** The car drives around, mapping your space. It's like Google Street View, but in your living room and way less accurate.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware: Because Software Alone Isn't Enough (Unfortunately)

### **Main Components:**

1. **Arduino Micro (aka The Brain):** The central command that keeps everything running. Kind of.
2. **ESP-01 Module:** Webserver on wheels (or, webserver on tiny plastic wheels) that occasionally connects to WiFi.
3. **OV7670 Camera:** It takes pictures, or so we hope.
4. **Servos:** For when you want your camera to do the Robot... literally.
5. **Batteries:** Powering this Frankenstein's monster of a project. Probably overworked, definitely underpaid.

### **Pin Layout:**
For those who love wiring diagrams (and who doesn‚Äôt?), here‚Äôs the pin layout:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Software: The Code That Powers the Mayhem üíª

- **Languages:** C++, the choice of masochists and those who like to pretend they‚Äôre better than Python developers.
- **IDE:** PlatformIO with VS Code, because why settle for just one layer of abstraction when you can have two?
- **Features:**
  - **Web Interface:** Access RoboCar via a slick (debatably) web interface. View pictures, change modes, or just see if the little guy is still alive.
  - **Image Processing:** It‚Äôs not exactly Skynet, but it‚Äôll snap blurry pictures of your couch like a pro.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements: If We Survive This Version

- **AI Integration:** Teach RoboCar to recognize faces. Or at least not mistake a shadow for an intruder.
- **Voice Control:** Because what‚Äôs cooler than shouting commands at a robot that may or may not understand you?
- **Laser Pointer:** Because why wouldn‚Äôt you want your security bot to also entertain your dog/toddler?
- **Microwave deathray:** Because we wondered what would happen if we crank the microwave radar to 11?

## üë®‚Äçüíª Contributions: Because Blame Should Be Shared

Developed by a team of highly skilled, occasionally sober, and always over-caffeinated individuals who firmly believe in the mantra: "If it compiles, ship it." Feel free to contribute, but remember: with great power comes great responsibility... and a lot of debugging.

Actually, this was developed 25% by lauri and the rest by me! üòé
